# Mukutu Router

Mukutu Router is a [Safe app](https://help.gnosis-safe.io/en/articles/4022022-what-are-safe-apps) for managing assets and interacting with smart contracts and dapps on multiple chains from one [Safe](https://app.safe.global/) account.

This app works as an intermediary between a [Safe account](https://app.safe.global/) on the origin chain and [Safe apps](https://help.gnosis-safe.io/en/articles/4022022-what-are-safe-apps) providing an interface to an app or asset on the remote chain.

This is achieved by advertising the remote chain and a [Hyperlane Interchain Account](https://docs.hyperlane.xyz/docs/developers/send) (which is an [EIP-1014/CREATE2 account](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1014)) as the currently connected chain and account respectively to the Safe app while also providing a [Safe apps SDK](https://github.com/safe-global/safe-apps-sdk) interface (including an RPC provider for read calls to the remote chain).
This allows us to leverage already existing user-friendly UI/UX of other Safe apps to compose the remote chain transaction.
This app then intercepts the sendTransaction call, translates it to a call to the [Hyperlane Interchain Account Router](https://docs.hyperlane.xyz/docs/developers/send) on the origin chain and submits it to the Safe Account for approval and execution.

**NOTE:** ðŸš§ Mukutu Router is still work in progress, check back over the next few weeks for regular updates.
